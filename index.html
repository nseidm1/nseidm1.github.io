Material Messaging: We don't store your data, period. I built this app when Material Design was first released several years ago, and it was the very first messaging app to have Material Design. That's all it is! Again, absolutely NO data is stored, sent to anyone, sold, transmitted to third parties, this is just a messaging app.
